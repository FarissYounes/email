the Confluence wiki into a vector store and use an LLM-powered system to efficiently answer team members' questions.

I understand that your team has developed an API to provide access to LLMs and embedding models. To proceed with my project, I would like to request access to this API. This would allow me to integrate the models into the system and ensure seamless retrieval and response generation based on the documentation.

Please let me know the necessary steps to gain access and any requirements or guidelines I should follow. I appreciate your time and support, and Iâ€™d be happy to provide any additional details about the project if needed.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
